Excerpt From "Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby":

> The Inadvertent Meteor

> When I first began my inquiry into preeventualism, I was relayed the following story. I was told that this was all I needed to understand the philosophy.
There was this sculptor who just wasn’t satisfied with his work. He had primarily studied traditional subject matter and excelled at sculpting both the human figure and elaborate vegetation. And he was really quite an exquisite sculptor. He just didn’t feel like he was making his mark upon the world.
By this time, he had aged well into his fifties and wanted to vaunt into the realm of legendary masters. So he began to construct a massive sculpture of two pears with beads of dew clinging precariously to them.

>The sculpture was enormous and hovered ominously above the sculptor’s hometown, held aloof by a massive infrastructure of struts and beams. In fact, the giant pears were so significant that they truly wreaked havoc on the Earth’s rotation, ever so slightly, what with a new asteroid-sized fruit basket clinging to it.
The government sent jets and war crafts to destroy the statue. They unleashed a vicious attack on the village, dismantling the statue, blowing it into thousands of pieces, chipping away at it with missiles. Soon enough, the statue was obliterated and all was back to normal.

> A huge chunk of the statue had taken orbit in the heavens and often veered perilously close to the planet. When it did, it was always met by an arsenal of advanced weaponry, which further damaged it and deflected its course skyward.
Eventually, this inadvertent meteor was nothing more than the size of a very daunting man. And, when it at last hit the ground, weathered and polished by its ninety year journey, it was hailed as an enigmatic masterpiece, a message from the great beyond. Here was a stunning likeness of a male nude looking wistfully into the sky with an intricate lace work of vines creeping around his waist and covering his improprieties.

> The statue was last sold for fifty-two million dollars and stayed in the permanent exhibit at the Louvre, with the plaque:
