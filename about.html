<h2>Every Time Machine Needs a License Plate</h2>
<hr/>

<p>The internet is a funny place. It's more about throughput than making things that last. There's a reason the <a href="">Internet Archive</a> has a <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a> to show us where we've been, lest we forget where we're going.</p>

<p>This is a personal time machine. I use it to remember who I've been and what I've been thinking, because I'm likely to change, and I want to remember the good stuff.</p>

<p>DR3WH0 is the license plate for my time machine.</p>
