<h2>Every Time Machine Needs a License Plate</h2>
<hr/>

<p>The internet is a funny place. It's more about throughput than making things last. There's a reason the Internet Archive has a Wayback Machine to show us where we've been, lest we forget where we're going.</p>

<p>This is a personal time machine. I use it to remember who I've been and what I've been thinking, because I'm likely to change, and I want to remember the good stuff.</p>
