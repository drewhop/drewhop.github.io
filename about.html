<h2>Every Time Machine Needs a License Plate</h2>
<hr/>

<p>The internet is a funny place. It's more about throughput than persistence. That's why the <a href="">Internet Archive</a> has a <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>: to show us where we've been, lest we forget where we're going.</p>

<p>This is the hub of my personal time machine, and DR3WH0 is its license plate.</p>
